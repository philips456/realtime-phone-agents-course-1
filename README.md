## Course Overview

This isn't your typical plug-and-play tutorial where you spin up a demo in five minutes and call it a day. 

Instead, we're building a **real estate company**, but with a twist … the employees will be **realtime voice agents**!

By the end of this course, you'll have a system capable of:

* ☎️ Receive inbound calls with Twilio
* 📞 Make outbound calls through Twilio
* 🏠 Search live property data using Superlinked
* ⚡ Run realtime conversations powered by FastRTC
* 🗣️ Transcribe speech instantly with Moonshine + Fast Whisper
* 🎙️ Generate lifelike voices using Kokoro + Orpheus 3B
* 🚀 Deploy open-source models on Runpod for GPU acceleration


Excited? Let's get started!

## Who is this course for?

This course is for Software Engineers, ML Engineers, and AI Engineers who want to level up by building complex end-to-end apps. It's not just a basic "Hello World" tutorial—it's a deep dive into making **production-ready voice agents**.


## Course Breakdown: Week by Week

Each week, you'll unlock **a new chapter of the journey**. You'll get:

* 🧾 A Substack article that walks through the concepts and code in detail
* 💻 A new batch of code pushed directly to this repo
* 🎥 A Live Session where we explore everything together

Here’s what the upcoming weeks look like 👇

## Getting Started

Before diving into the lessons, make sure you have everything set up properly:

1. 📋 **Initial Setup**: Follow the instructions in [`docs/GETTINGS_STARTED.md`](docs/GETTINGS_STARTED.md) to configure your environment and install dependencies.
2. 📚 **Learn Lesson by Lesson**: Once setup is complete, come back here and follow the lessons in order.

Each lesson builds on the previous one, so it's important to follow them sequentially!

---

## Lesson 0: Project Overview and Architecture

**Goal**: Understand the big picture and architecture of the realtime phone agent system.

### Steps:

1. 📖 Read the [Substack article](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/p/the-architecture-of-realtime-phone) to understand the overall architecture
2. 🎥 Watch the [Live Session recording](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/p/the-architecture-of-phone-calling) for a deeper dive

This lesson sets the foundation for everything that follows!

---

## Lesson 1: Building Realtime Voice Agents with FastRTC

**Goal**: Build your first working voice agent using FastRTC and integrate it with Twilio.

### Steps:

1. 📖 **Read the Article**: Start with the [Substack article](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/p/building-realtime-voice-agents-with) to understand FastRTC fundamentals
2. 📓 **Work Through the Notebook**: Open and run through [`notebooks/lesson_1_fastrtc_agents.ipynb`](notebooks/lesson_1_fastrtc_agents.ipynb) to get hands-on experience
3. 💻 **Explore the Code**: Dive into the repository code to see how everything is implemented
4. 🚀 **Run the Applications**: Try both deployment options:

#### Option A: Gradio Application (Quick Demo)

Run the Gradio interface (check out demo videos in the [Substack article](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/p/building-realtime-voice-agents-with)):

```bash
make start-gradio-application
```

This starts an interactive web interface where you can test the voice agent locally.

> **_NOTE:_**  If you get the error 'No such file or directory: 'ffprobe', just install _ffmpeg_ in your system to solve it

#### Option B: FastAPI Call Center (Production-Ready)

For a production-ready setup that can receive real phone calls:

**Step 1**: Start the call center application

```bash
make start-call-center
```

This starts a FastAPI application using Docker Compose on port 8000.

**Step 2**: Expose your local server to the internet

```bash
make start-ngrok-tunnel
```

Or manually:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

**Step 3**: Connect to Twilio

Follow the instructions in the [article](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/p/building-realtime-voice-agents-with) to:
- Configure your Twilio account
- Connect your ngrok URL to Twilio
- Start receiving real phone calls!

🎥 **Join the Live Session**: [Join Premium](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/subscribe), and you'll receive a notification when we are live on **Sunday, November 23rd at 5PM CET** for a complete walkthrough and Q&A!

## Course Overview

This isn't your typical plug-and-play tutorial where you spin up a demo in five minutes and call it a day. 

Instead, we're building a **real estate company**, but with a twist … the employees will be **realtime voice agents**!

By the end of this course, you'll have a system capable of:

* ☎️ Receive inbound calls with Twilio
* 📞 Make outbound calls through Twilio
* 🏠 Search live property data using Superlinked
* ⚡ Run realtime conversations powered by FastRTC
* 🗣️ Transcribe speech instantly with Moonshine + Fast Whisper
* 🎙️ Generate lifelike voices using Kokoro + Orpheus 3B
* 🚀 Deploy open-source models on Runpod for GPU acceleration


Excited? Let's get started!

## Getting Started

Before diving into the lessons, make sure you have everything set up properly:

1. 📋 **Initial Setup**: Follow the instructions in [`docs/GETTINGS_STARTED.md`](docs/GETTINGS_STARTED.md) to configure your environment and install dependencies.
2. 📚 **Learn Lesson by Lesson**: Once setup is complete, come back here and follow the lessons in order.

Each lesson builds on the previous one, so it's important to follow them sequentially!

---

## Lesson 0: Project Overview and Architecture

**Goal**: Understand the big picture and architecture of the realtime phone agent system.

### Steps:

1. 📖 Read the [Substack article](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/p/the-architecture-of-realtime-phone) to understand the overall architecture
2. 🎥 Watch the [Live Session recording](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/p/the-architecture-of-phone-calling) for a deeper dive

This lesson sets the foundation for everything that follows!

---

## Lesson 1: Building Realtime Voice Agents with FastRTC

**Goal**: Build your first working voice agent using FastRTC and integrate it with Twilio.

### Steps:

1. 📖 **Read the Article**: Start with the [Substack article](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/p/building-realtime-voice-agents-with) to understand FastRTC fundamentals
2. 📓 **Work Through the Notebook**: Open and run through [`notebooks/lesson_1_fastrtc_agents.ipynb`](notebooks/lesson_1_fastrtc_agents.ipynb) to get hands-on experience
3. 💻 **Explore the Code**: Dive into the repository code to see how everything is implemented
4. 🚀 **Run the Applications**: Try both deployment options:

#### Option A: Gradio Application (Quick Demo)

Run the Gradio interface (check out demo videos in the [Substack article](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/p/building-realtime-voice-agents-with)):

```bash
make start-gradio-application
```

This starts an interactive web interface where you can test the voice agent locally.

> **_NOTE:_**  If you get the error 'No such file or directory: 'ffprobe', just install _ffmpeg_ in your system to solve it

#### Option B: FastAPI Call Center (Production-Ready)

For a production-ready setup that can receive real phone calls:

**Step 1**: Start the call center application

```bash
make start-call-center
```

This starts a FastAPI application using Docker Compose on port 8000.

**Step 2**: Expose your local server to the internet

```bash
make start-ngrok-tunnel
```

Or manually:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

**Step 3**: Connect to Twilio

Follow the instructions in the [article](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/p/building-realtime-voice-agents-with) to:
- Configure your Twilio account
- Connect your ngrok URL to Twilio
- Start receiving real phone calls!

🎥 **Join the Live Session**: [Join Premium](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/subscribe), and you'll receive a notification when we are live on **Sunday, November 23rd at 5PM CET** for a complete walkthrough and Q&A!

## Lesson 2: The Missing Layer in Modern AI Retrieval

**Goal**: Learn how to implement advanced search capabilities for realtime voice agents using Superlinked to handle complex, multi-attribute queries.

### Steps:

1. 📖 **Read the Article**: Start with the [Substack article](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/p/the-missing-layer-in-modern-ai-retrieval) to understand:
   - Why traditional vector search isn't enough for multi-attribute queries
   - How Superlinked combines different data types (text, numbers, categories) into a unified search space
   - The limitations of metadata filters, multiple searches, and re-ranking approaches

2. 📓 **Work Through the Notebook**: Open and run through [`notebooks/lesson_2_superlinked_property_search.ipynb`](notebooks/lesson_2_superlinked_property_search.ipynb) to learn:
   - How to define different Space types (TextSimilaritySpace, NumberSpace, CategoricalSimilaritySpace)
   - How to combine spaces into a single searchable index
   - How to dynamically adjust weights at query time

3. 💻 **Explore the Code**: Dive into the repository to see how Superlinked integrates with our voice agent:
   - Check out `src/realtime_phone_agents/infrastructure/superlinked/` for the implementation
   - Review `src/realtime_phone_agents/agent/tools/property_search.py` to see how the search tool is exposed to the agent
   
   _We'll explore the code in detail during the Live Session!_

4. 🚀 **Test the Complete System**: Now it's time to see everything work together!

   **Step 1**: Start the call center application

   ```bash
   make start-call-center
   ```

   **Step 2**: Expose your local server (if not already running)

   ```bash
   make start-ngrok-tunnel
   ```

   **Step 3**: Call your Twilio number and test the property search

   Try asking the agent:
   
   > _"Do you have apartments in Barrio de Salamanca of at most 900,000 euros?"_

   Wait for the response. The agent should find and return information about the only apartment in the dataset ([`data/properties.csv`](data/properties.csv)) that meets these criteria!

   This demonstrates how the voice agent can now handle complex queries combining location (Barrio de Salamanca) and price constraints (≤ €900,000) in real-time.

🎥 **Join the Live Session**: [Join Premium](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/subscribe) for the live walkthrough on **Saturday, November 30th** where we'll dive deep into the code and answer your questions!
